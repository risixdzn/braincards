# Privacy Policy

### The Gist

Caards will collect certain non-personally identifying information about you as you use our app (email / profile pictures). We will not use this data for anything outside the app.

Cookies are used only for essential purposes (storing auth credentials).

Before using Caards, please read through the entire Privacy Policy below and agree with all the details.

### Questions

If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, please contact us at caardsapp@gmail.com.

### Users

Similar to most app operators, Caards collects non-personally-identifying information such as device information, language preference, and the date and time of each user's interaction with the app. This data helps us understand how users engage with Caards, and we may share aggregated trends without revealing individual identities.

Caards may also collect potentially personally-identifying information, such as Internet Protocol addresses, which are only used to block potentially malicious users and ensure the security of our app.

### Cookies

Caards uses cookies to identify and track user interactions within the app. Users who do not wish to have cookies placed on their devices can disable them, but it may impact certain features of the app.

### Data Storage

Caards utilizes third-party vendors and hosting partners to manage the necessary infrastructure for the app. While users retain full rights to their data, it may be stored on third-party servers and transmitted through third-party networks.

Certainly! Here's an additional paragraph addressing the handling of payment information:

### Payment Information

Caards prioritizes the security and privacy of your payment information. We want to assure you that Caards does not store or handle any payment details provided by users. For all transactions, we leverage the secure payment processing services offered by Stripe (available at [stripe.com/privacy](https://stripe.com/privacy)). This means that your payment information is directly handled by Stripe, a trusted and reputable third-party payment processor. We have implemented this approach to ensure the highest standards of security for your financial data, and we recommend reviewing Stripe's privacy policy for further details on how they handle payment information. Your trust and confidence in the security of your information are of utmost importance to us. If you have any concerns or questions regarding payment security, please don't hesitate to reach out to us at caardsapp@gmail.com.

### Privacy Policy Changes

Although most changes are likely to be minor, Caards may update its Privacy Policy periodically and at its sole discretion. Users are encouraged to check this page frequently for any changes. Continued use of the app after any modifications to this Privacy Policy indicates acceptance of the changes.
